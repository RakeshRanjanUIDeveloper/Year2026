1. How to call a method when a component is rendered for the first time?
 - In React (functional components), to call a method only once when the component is rendered for the first time,
 - we should use the useEffect hook with an empty dependency array [].
 - useEffect(() => { ... }, []) behaves like componentDidMount() in class components.
 - The empty array [] means "no dependencies", so the effect runs only once after the first render.
====================================
2. How to call a method on every re-render of a component?
 - There are two main ways to call a method on every render of a React functional component
 - Call the method directly inside the component body - But it Runs before the JSX is returned.
 - Use useEffect without a dependency array - But it After the component’s JSX is rendered to the DOM.
====================================================================
3. How to call a method immediately after state is updated or component is re-rendered?
- Use useEffect and include the state variable in the dependency array
 ========================================
4. How to force a component to re-render without using useState?
 - Using useEffect with the specific state in the dependency array
 - Using useLayoutEffect for synchronous effect after DOM mutation
========================================================================
5. How to re-render a component on value change?
 - Use useState — Re-render on state change
 - Use props — Re-render when props change
 - Use useEffect if you want to react to value changes
===========================================================================
6. What is reconciliation in React?
- The process of comparing the new Virtual DOM with the previous one to determine the changes.
=============================================================================
7. What is React Fiber architecture?
- React Fiber is the complete rewrite of React’s core algorithm introduced in React 16 (2017) 
  to make rendering more flexible, incremental, and interruptible.
- Before React 16, React’s rendering was synchronous and non-interruptible. This meant:
  If an update took a long time, it would block the main thread.
