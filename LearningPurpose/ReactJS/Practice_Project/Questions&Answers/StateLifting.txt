1. What is state Lifting? Explain with Examples in Details.
    - State Lifting in React is when you move state up to a common parent component so that multiple child components
     (even instances of the same component) can share and update the same piece of state.
    - Why do we Lift state ?
        - React promotes unidirectional data flow.
        - If two or more components need to access or modify the same state, then that state should live 
            in their closest common ancestor.
        - By lifting the state up, we make one source of truth.
