We can write tests in JavaScript or typescript. 
It is open source.

Mocha is a JavaScript test runner
Implicit Assertion => should() and()
	- .should() command is used to make assertions about the current subject.
	- .and() is used to chain multiple assertions after a .should() statement.
	- .should() starts the assertion chain. & .and() continues using the same subject.
Explicit Assertion => expect() assert()
describe(), only(), skip(), beforeEach() - 
beforeEach - within describe => Runs before each test in that describe group
		   - outside describe => Runs before each test in that specific file 
WHY CLI ? 
	- Easier, faster and efficient, less memory consumption, to integrate testing with external process
npx cypress run - it run all the test headless
